## Important: gguf file, llama model  

the llama 7B gguf file here is blank, as the real file is about 5GB big! too much for hosting here on github.  
you may download this gguf file (this is the llm language model file) from huggingface here:   
https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF  

other models are of course available, and maybe left in this directory provided the llama-cpp framework (and version!) will accomodate them.
